Breeze is a library for numerical processing, machine learning, and natural language processing.
Its primary focus is on being generic, clean, and powerful without sacrificing (much) efficiency.

The library currently consists of several parts: 

* breeze-math: Linear algebra and numerics routines
* breeze-process: Libraries for managing datasets and job pipelines.
* breeze-learn: Machine Learning and Optimization.
* breeze-viz: Vizualization and plotting

Possible future releases:
* breeze-fst: Finite state toolkit

Breeze is the merger of the ScalaNLP and Scalala projects, because 
one of the original maintainers is unable to continue development.
The Scalala parts are largely rewritten.
